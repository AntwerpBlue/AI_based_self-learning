# AI based Self-Learning

## Idea

AI tools are for everyone, how to make yourself different from others ---- taste, communication, influence

When I was freshman in USTC, I encountered PKUFlyingPig, and tried to learn many CS courses during my undergraduate. Just like many schoolemates, most of my courses were also leant by myself. After years of self-learning, the tools have converted from online courses and textbooks to AI agent. Usually, we ask Deepseek to explain certain conception, for example, 'Tell me about Lock in Java'. But is this the correct way to use AI agent?

Nowadays, everyone has access to LLM, and everone can ask LLM to do simple tasks that can be realized in simple prompts. Then whats the difference between you, a well-educated graduate student, and a student just complete a 2 hours' lesson about how to use AI? You have to make the diffence!

1. Simply ask certain conception gives you seperated understanding of subjects. Like many awfully written textbooks, that just explain conceptions one-by-one but dont tell the relation between conceptions,  understanding are like islands on the ocean, without bridges between them, you cannot grab the whole view.
